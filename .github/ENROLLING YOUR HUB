SmartThings CLI
Install
Download the SmartThings CLI for your platform: https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/smartthings-cli/releases

Using SmartThings CLI, enroll to my SmartThings Edge Drivers channel

./smartthings edge:channels:enroll --channel 2d9568d4-da3e-4b3b-9178-626d122e5d7e

Install the driver of your choice, from my channel to your hub

./smartthings edge:drivers:install --channel 2d9568d4-da3e-4b3b-9178-626d122e5d7e

Uninstall
To uninstall a driver from your hub:

./smartthings edge:drivers:uninstall
Add the device to your hub
After installation, simply start a discovery from the SmartThings app to add your device. If it is already paired, make sure to remove it from the SmartThings app first, then start the discovery.

Check that the Edge driver is the actual driver used
When an Edge driver exists, it should automatically be selected even though your device may be supported natively or with a Groovy Device Handler. However, to make sure the Edge driver is in use, open your device in the SmartThings app and check that the menu now has a "Driver" entry. If you want to revert from the Edge driver back to a Groovy Device Handler, you first need to uninstall the Edge driver.
